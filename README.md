The Odin Project - Foundations - Etch a Sketch css grid

I played around with CodePen to get this right. It is pretty simple and ugly, but I am most excited about the JavaScript functionality. The JS builds basically the whole thing. I don't feel like making the UI pretty right now. That, and the grid size drop down, will come in v2.0.
