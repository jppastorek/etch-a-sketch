The Odin Project - Foundations - Etch a Sketch css grid

I played around with CodePen to get this right. It is pretty simple and ugly, but I am most excited about the JavaScript functionality. The JS builds basically the whole thing. I don't feel like making the UI pretty right now. That, and the grid size drop down, will come in v2.0.


---Version 2.0

UI has been redesigned with CSS. Buttons now have functionality. Still trying to figure out how to use a color picker. Also, we will have a checkbox to toggle the grid lines. I'm thinking that in order to change the grid size, I'll use a button once the slider has been moved.


--Version 2.1

Buttons all have functionality. Scratched the color picker and the slider (though you can still see the slider). I'm just tired of working on this. The slider doesn't rebuild a grid correctly, for some reason there is a large gray spot at the bottom after building the divs. The divs also aren't squared. Also, I refactored the code to make it nice and neat. Took the flow from someone else in the Odin Project.
