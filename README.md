The Odin Project - Foundations - Etch a Sketch css grid

I played around with CodePen to get this right. It is pretty simple and ugly, but I am most excited about the JavaScript functionality. The JS builds basically the whole thing. I don't feel like making the UI pretty right now. That, and the grid size drop down, will come in v2.0.


---Version 2.0

UI has been redesigned with CSS. Buttons now have functionality. Still trying to figure out how to use a color picker. Also, we will have a checkbox to toggle the grid lines. I'm thinking that in order to change the grid size, I'll use a button once the slider has been moved.
